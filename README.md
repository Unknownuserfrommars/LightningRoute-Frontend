# LightningRoute-Frontend (Python Version)
Frontend of Lightning Route Project
Project develop during the MOONSHOT 48 Hackathon.
UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
Note: The old version uses Streamlit Cloud as Backend and is EXTREMELY UNSTABLE (errors out every few minutes or so)
Also, this is very buggy. I cannot figure out how to let Streamlit Cloud have ffmpeg as a library and cant find a way to install it.

We are currently reworking this project with (hopefully these features):
- login
- subscription (we need money to pay for the OpenAI API endpoint)
- better docs
- **THE MOST IMPORTANT**: *Rewrite* the whole stuff in HTML&CSS&JS.
